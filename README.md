# Netcompany_Office_climate_monitoring
The Office Climate Monitoring project will focus on collecting workplace data such as the noise level and air quality index, so that we can administrate our office space and provide solutions based on the collected data. To detect the noise level and air quality index, we will be using loT devices and install them around our offices. Each loT device contains a noise sensor, air quality sensor and other information (area the device is installed, device identity). Date is retrieved from these sensors and saved to a database. Furthermore, administrators collect data from the database and uses this via a web browser.

This is the web portal of the project. For further information, please contact phamnguyenvu1309@gmail.com
